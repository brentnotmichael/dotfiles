# dotfiles
My dotfiles. This is a thing people do, right?

## setup-dotfiles.sh
Copies directories to current user's home directory as dotfiles (`vim`
directory as
`~/.vim` directory)
Creates hard links from visible files in the dotfiles directory to user's home
directory as dotfiles (`vimrc` as `~/.vimrc`)

## .vimrc
This is my .vimrc
